# CPM - APT-like package manager
This is the ComputerCraft Package Manager - a lightweight tool for easy file downloads from external repositories for the popular Minecraft Mod "ComputerCraft" with update checks.
This project is currently in beta phase and the official repository doesn't contain any useful scripts at the moment.

# Install CPM on your ComputerCraft computer
Our releases will always contain a pastebin which can be used to easily download cpm to a CC computer:
    pastebin get Esehqdwn cpm

*If you use custom settings for cpm, feel free to clone the paste and modify the configuration to match your needs.*

# Using CPM to install and manage software
Currently CPM can only be used to automate the download process of software from the configured repository.
